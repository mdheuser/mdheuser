# Hi there, I'm mdheuser 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on systems programming and low-level development. Currently honing my skills through **42 School**, where I'm building a solid foundation in C programming, algorithms, and UNIX systems.

## 🛠️ Main Projects

### 🐚 [42minishell](https://github.com/mdheuser/42minishell)
A simple UNIX shell implementation that replicates core shell functionalities including:
- Command execution with pipes and redirections
- Environment variable management
- Built-in commands (cd, echo, export, etc.)
- Process management and signal handling
- Adheres to POSIX standards

### 🎮 [wally](https://github.com/mdheuser/wally)
An interactive C-based game featuring life and death mechanics. Showcases graphics programming, game logic implementation, and real-time user interaction.

### 🗺️ [42_so_long](https://github.com/mdheuser/42_so_long)
A simple 2D game constructed in C based on maps (2D arrays of characters). Demonstrates graphics rendering and game state management.

### 🔄 [42_push_swap](https://github.com/mdheuser/42_push_swap)
A sophisticated sorting algorithm implementation that sorts numbers using two stacks with a limited set of operations. Focuses on algorithm optimization and efficiency.

### 📚 [42_libft](https://github.com/mdheuser/42_libft)
My custom C library featuring a collection of functions to replace standard built-in functions. A foundational project for understanding memory management and string manipulation.

### 💼 [modern_portfolio](https://github.com/mdheuser/modern_portfolio)
A responsive modern portfolio website built with SCSS, showcasing web development and design skills.
